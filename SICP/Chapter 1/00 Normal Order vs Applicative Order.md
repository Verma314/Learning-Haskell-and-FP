## Normal Order
Fully exapand the given expression. And then evalutate.

In the normal order, we do not evaulte the operands (arguments) until their values are needed.


## Applicative Order  

Evaluate the arguments and then apply the procedure on those arguments.


*so is it like, in applicative order, the arguments get evaluated before the procedure is applied? and in normal order, the procedure gets evaluated first and then the "expanded" procedure is applied on all arguments?*
